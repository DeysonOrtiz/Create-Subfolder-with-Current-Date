# Create Subfolder with Current Date

This script is an AppleScript that creates a subfolder with the current date in the input folder. The subfolder will be named in the format mm-Month-yyyy.

How to Use

Open Automator on your Mac.
Choose "Service" as the type of document.
Add the AppleScript code provided above to the workflow.
Save the workflow as a service with a descriptive name, such as "Create Subfolder with Current Date".
The service can now be accessed from the right-click context menu in Finder or from the Automator app.
Notes

The script assumes that the input folder is a valid directory path.
The subfolder will be created with the current date at the time the script is run.
The script will create the subfolder only if it does not already exist. If the subfolder exists, the script will not modify it in any way.
